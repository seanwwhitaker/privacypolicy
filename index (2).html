  <h1>SpamShield Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 10, 2025</p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      SpamShield is a browser extension designed to detect spam and phishing emails and warn users before they interact with suspicious content. Your privacy and data security are our top priorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      This policy explains what information SpamShield collects, how it is used, and your rights regarding that information.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      SpamShield does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII). All analysis of emails and links occurs <strong>locally</strong> within your browser.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>SpamShield does not access your email account or send data to external servers.</li>
      <li>SpamShield does not track your browsing activity.</li>
      <li>SpamShield does not collect or share any analytics, advertising data, or user identifiers.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. How SpamShield Works</h2>
    <p>
      SpamShield analyzes the structure and content of emails within the browser to detect patterns associated with spam or phishing. All detection and alerting processes are handled entirely on your device. No remote code is executed, and no data leaves your local environment.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      SpamShield does not share, sell, or transmit any information to third parties. Because no personal or usage data is collected, there is nothing to disclose or sell.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      SpamShield may request limited permissions (such as access to read email metadata or display notifications) strictly to perform its security functions. These permissions are only used for spam detection and alerts — never for advertising or tracking purposes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>
      All processing is done locally in your browser. SpamShield uses secure coding practices to prevent unauthorized access, tampering, or data exposure.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This privacy policy may be updated periodically. When significant changes are made, the updated version will be posted with a revised "Last Updated" date.
    </p>
